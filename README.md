# Repository for IBM Data Science course projects

This repository saves The final Capstone of the IBM Data Science certificate https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science

In this capstone, as a Data Scientist of the company Space Y, we will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, and much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage.

Summary of methodologies:

 	- Collect data through SpaceX API
	
	- Data Collection with Web Scraping
	
	- Convert the data into a dataframe and then perform some data wrangling
	
	- EDA with SQL
	
	- EDA with visualization tools from the seaborn library
	
	- Analyze the proximity of launch locations with Folium
	
	- Analyze launch records interactively with Plotly Dash 
	
	- Machine Learning Prediction
  
Summary of all results

	As a result we got several satisfactory models with an accuracy level of 83.3%.
